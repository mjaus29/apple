## üìù Description

Welcome to my Interactive iPhone Pro Website project! This is a visually stunning, interactive clone of Apple's iPhone Pro website using React, GSAP animations, and Three.js for 3D modeling.

I wanted to recreate Apple's premium user experience while learning advanced animation and 3D development techniques.

This project demonstrates how modern web technologies can create compelling product showcases that engage users and drive conversions.

The project features custom animations, a video carousel with progress tracking, an interactive 3D iPhone model with color customization, and performance monitoring with Sentry.

**Technologies Used:** React, Vite, Three.js, GSAP, Tailwind CSS, and Sentry.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Custom Video Carousel with Progress Tracking:** Developed a sophisticated video carousel that automatically plays videos as users scroll through the highlights section. Each video has a progress bar that tracks playback, and users can pause, play, or restart videos with custom controls.

- **Interactive 3D iPhone Model:** Created a fully interactive 3D iPhone model that users can rotate and view from different angles. The model includes color customization options that update in real-time, allowing users to visualize the iPhone in different finishes.

- **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Implemented numerous scroll-triggered animations using GSAP that reveal content as users scroll through the page, creating an engaging and dynamic user experience similar to Apple's website.
